Objective

    Convert a single input pulse of width tt (e.g., from a microcontroller) into a steady analog voltage VoutVout​ that is proportional to tt.

🛠️ Circuit Principles

You want:

    A forward-biased diode to allow current in during the pulse

    An RC-type network to integrate the pulse over time

    A buffered capacitor to hold the resulting voltage

    Optional R‖L shaping to smooth the edge and suppress noise, but it’s secondary

✅ Recommended Circuit for PWM-to-Voltage (Simplified):

        Pulse
         |
        ▶| (D1)
         |         
         +───────┬────────→ Vout (to op-amp buffer)
                 |
                [C]
                 |
                GND

    D1 = fast signal diode (e.g., 1N4148)

    C = storage capacitor (e.g., 1 µF to 10 µF depending on resolution and desired decay rate)

    Output goes directly to a high-impedance buffer op-amp

This basic circuit charges the cap during the pulse, and holds the voltage afterward.
📐 How It Works

    When a pulse arrives, D1 conducts → cap charges toward pulse voltage

    The longer the pulse, the higher the final voltage on the cap

    Once the pulse ends, D1 turns off → charge stays on cap

    Output is fed to a buffer → steady voltage output

⏲️ Capacitor Voltage vs. Pulse Width

Assuming pulse amplitude VpVp​, pulse width tt, and capacitance CC, and that the diode drop is small:
Vout≈Vp⋅(1−e−t/(RonC))
Vout​≈Vp​⋅(1−e−t/(Ron​C))

Where RonRon​ is the effective path resistance through the diode and source.

    For short pulses: linear relation
    Vout∝tVout​∝t

    For longer pulses: saturates at VpVp​

🧱 To Improve Linearity:

    Add a series resistor before the diode to create a predictable time constant.

    Add a bleed resistor across the capacitor to allow slow decay between pulses.

    +──────▶|────+────→ Buffer
    |             |
    Pulse       [C]
                  |
                 GND
                  |
                [R_bleed]
                  |
                 GND

    This lets the voltage drop back down slowly if no pulse occurs for a while.

⚠️ Important Notes

    This only works well if pulse widths are spaced apart enough to allow the op-amp to sample the voltage

    To convert repetitive PWM into a voltage, a true low-pass RC or LC filter is better

    Your inductor and R‖L ideas are fine but not strictly necessary for this goal

✅ TL;DR

You don’t need R‖L in this case. Just:

    A diode

    A capacitor

    An optional bleed resistor

    A buffer op-amp

And you’ll get a steady voltage that depends on the width of the input pulse.
